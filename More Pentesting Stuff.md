Performing Mac Flooding: <br>
macof is a built-in command meant for a MAC flooding attack on the network <br>
macof -help <br>
Go on a linux VM terminal <br>
su -> macof -i eth0/wlan0 -s [IP Address] <br>
eth0 for ethernet , wlan0 for wireless (Find using ifconfig) <br>
In the IP address, put the computer you want to flood, if you do the router, the whole network going down lol. Find the IP address with Angry IP Scanner
You’ll see a lot of MAC addresses appear, if you want to stop flooding, just type Ctrl + C 


The effect of this attack may vary across implementations, however the desired effect (by the attacker) is to force legitimate MAC addresses out of the MAC address table, causing significant quantities of incoming frames to be flooded out on all ports.


The attacker may also follow up with an ARP spoofing attack which will allow them to retain access to privileged data after switches recover from the initial MAC flooding attack.


On Wireshark, enter the interface on your computer, and you can track the traffic
